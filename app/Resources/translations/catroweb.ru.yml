  text1: Imagine that each Catrobat program is a cake, a very special cake that comes with its recipe (programming blocks). All members of the Catrobat community share their cakes along with their recipes. This means that you can enjoy the cakes and learn how to make them yourself!
  text2: 'There are no secret recipes: the instructions on how to make these cakes are open for anyone to use, reuse, modify, and serve as inspiration for new ideas... I mean cakes.'
  text3: "You can eat the cakes as well as copy other people's recipes to make your own, maybe with different ingredients. This freedom comes with two simple requirements:"
  text4: "In setting up the Catrobat community, we decided to adopt this approach since we believe that it supports learning and creativity within the community. By sharing recipes and ingredients (scripts and artwork), people can build upon one another's ideas and everyone will benefit."
  text5: In designing the Catrobat website, we included features to encourage people to share and to give credit to others. On each program page, you can always download the original scripts for the program. If you remix a program (modifying the scripts or artwork, and sharing the result), we encourage you to give credit in the Program Notes, mentioning the people and program that inspired you.

    item1: "By uploading a program to our websites, you accept and agree to put this work under certain free licenses of uploaded Catrobat programs. Similar to the free licenses under which the Catrobat system itself is available to you, these free licenses of uploaded Catrobat programs give everyone the right to learn from work previously uploaded by others and to adapt and remix that work to build their own new fascinating games, animations, and other programs. This allows everyone to 'stand on the shoulders of one's peers', one of them being you! Your work will thus benefit the whole world and remain free for everyone to use, a bit similar to text and pictures freely contributed to Wikipedia by volunteers from all over the world. Think of it as your present to humanity: you give to everyone, and all others that upload their work to our websites give to you. Thus an uploaded program is a gift of great value which its owner is giving to you for free, with the condition that you participate in the community on the same terms."
    item2: You do not have to accept the gift; if you do, certain rules apply. The benefits of these rules are that you can learn from the work and build upon it to make even cooler stuff yourself, which you can then, e.g., again upload to our websites as your own. Another benefit is that these licenses make sure that you cannot be held liable for any problems arising to others through their use of your program.
    item3: "One important additional condition is that you clearly give attribution to the authors on whose works you based your own work. At the same time, we will work hard so that your work will be clearly appreciated by others to having been contributed by you, by giving attribution to the unique name you have freely chosen to represent you in Catrobat's community, and by giving others the opportunity to express their gratitude to you in public ways for having given your work to everyone, and in particular to them."

    item2: These licenses make all parts of Catrobat both free of charge to you as well as free in the sense of giving you the freedom to use them however you like, with only a few restrictions ensuring, among others, that the Catrobat system will forever remain free and useful for everyone.

    title1: Registration
    text1: First you need to create an account. After that you can upload your created program. Don’t worry it is easy and you only need to think of a username and a password. After filling out both, click on ‘Login or Register’. That’s it!
    title2: Загрузить
    text2: 'After the registration process you are able to upload your game. Just think about a name and add a description. Also add #AliceJam150 in the description field.'
    title3: Search for your program
    text3: Go to your Pocket Code profile where all your programs are listed or search directly for your program by using the search and your program name.
    title4: Create Android app
    text4: Directly on the program detail page you can create an Android app. By clicking on ‘Prepare app’ the app will be built.
    title5: Download app
    text5: 'After the building process you can download your program as an app. This downloaded app needs to be uploaded again directly on the Game Jolt Site in order to participate in the %link%.'
    title6: Register/Login at GameJolt.com
    text6: "Visit %link% and click on ‘Log In’ or 'Sign Up!' in the menu. If you already have an account just log in, if not, you need to register with your Email address, Username and Password."
    title7: Upload your game on the Game Jolt Site

As Engine/Language/Creation Tool choose 'Other' and add to the field Other Engine/Language/Tool 'Android'. As 'Development' status choose 'Finished/Stable'. Make sure to include #AliceJam150 in the description so it appears on the %link% page."
